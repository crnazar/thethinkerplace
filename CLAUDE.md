# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**The Thinker Place** - A new project currently in initial setup phase.

## Current State

This repository is newly initialized with minimal structure. As the codebase develops, this document should be updated with:

- Build and development commands
- Testing and linting procedures
- Architecture and design patterns
- Key dependencies and their purposes
- Development workflow and conventions

## Getting Started

This section will be populated once the project technology stack and build system are established.

## Notes for Future Development

When adding content to this file:
- Include specific commands for build, test, and lint operations
- Document high-level architecture decisions that span multiple files
- Explain non-obvious design patterns or conventions
- Avoid repeating information easily discoverable from file structure
